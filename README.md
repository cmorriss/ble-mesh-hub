# Overview
This project is intended to serve as a hub for a bespoke ESP32 based Bluetooth Low Energy mesh network that I created here: https://github.com/cmorriss/ble-mesh-sensor.

This hub implementation could use some more work, however it has sufficient functionality to receive and publish data to AWS IoT Core.
